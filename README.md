# React Weather App
Welcome to the React Weather App repository! This project allows you to create a simple weather application using React JS. The app fetches current weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and displays key information such as temperature, weather condition, humidity, and wind speed for a specified city.

## Usage
Get your free API key from OpenWeatherMap by signing up.
Copy the API key and create a .env file in the root of the project:
REACT_APP_API_KEY=your_api_key
Replace your_api_key with the API key you obtained.

## Features
User-friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive design for easy navigation.
Dynamic Weather Data: Real-time weather information based on the entered city.
Customization: Easily integrate additional features or modify the app to suit your needs.
